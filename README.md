👋 Hi, my name is Alan and I run Pittflix.com, a site I use to share & showcase my work. My github...handle? is @blackpearl-git.

👀 I’m interested in self-hosted projects of all kinds. I believe in a future where people host their own 'data' via a simple, inexpensive self-hosted NAS. There's no need to create giant honeypots of personal info controlled by companies with no inherent incentive to protect the security of that data, beyond their own self-preservation and business interests. I call it Distributed Privacy.   🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement a self-hosted home assistant AI/LLM, rather than rely on Jeff Bezos. 

💞️ I'm currently looking for work as a Red Hat Certified Server Administrator with 8 years of hands-on Linux experience. If you need a Server Admin, reach out!

📫 How to reach me ... alan@pittflix.com, or on the Pittflix discord channel. If you got here from my resume, firstly, thank you for reading it, and my personal email is listed there. I'd be a great employee! 

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: The human body is a biome that supports over 10,000 different species of other organisms. We've been self-hosting for a long time.
